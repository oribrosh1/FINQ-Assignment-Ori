# React User Profile Viewer

## Introduction

This React application provides an interface to display user profiles fetched from the `randomuser.me` API. It allows users to view random people's profiles, manage these profiles, and interact with a custom backend to save and retrieve user history.

## Key Features

- **Fetch Users**: Load random user data from `randomuser.me`.
- **User History**: View and manage saved profiles.
- **Detailed Profile Management**: Includes options to save, update, and delete user profiles as well as navigate through user data.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- A modern web browser

### Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/react-user-profiles.git
cd react-user-profiles



Then, install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install


Running the Application
To start the application on your local development server:

```bash
npm start


This will serve the app at http://localhost:3000.


## Libraries and Tools
### React
Chosen for its component-based architecture, which facilitates the maintenance and management of complex applications.

### Material-UI (MUI)
Provides a wide range of ready-to-use components that are customizable and responsive, ensuring a consistent look and feel while speeding up development.

### Zustand
A minimalistic state management tool used for its straightforward setup and excellent performance, helping manage global state without the verbosity of alternatives like Redux.

### Axios
Utilized for handling API requests. Its promise-based nature allows for easy handling of asynchronous data fetching and integration with React's lifecycle methods.


##  Application Structure
src/: Source files for the React application.
api/: Setup for Axios instances and API call functions.
components/: Reusable UI components.
pages/: Components corresponding to application pages/routes.
store/: Zustand store for global state management.
Development Best Practices
Modular Design: Components are built to be reusable and modular, making the codebase more manageable and scalable.
Efficient State Management: Zustand is used to avoid prop drilling and ensure a clean and efficient state management solution.
Error Handling: Implemented in API interactions to enhance user experience and robustness.
